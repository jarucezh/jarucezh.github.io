Hello, everyone! My name is Hao ZHENG. I’m a third-year Ph.D. student from the Automation & Knowledge Laboratory, Tokyo Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Kanezaki. Before that, I got my M.Sc. degree from CUHK in 2020. My research interests include machine learning, transfer learning, and few-shot classification. I have been a reviewer of NIPS 2023, ICLR 2024 and ICRA 2024. If you are interested in my research or our lab, please feel free to contact me!
