However, the cross-domain setup poses a challenge in the form of domain shift between the training and testing domains. Previous research has demonstrated that the encoder can disentangle features into domain-shared and domain-specific features. However, poorly estimated domain-specific features can lead to inadequate generalization on the unseen domain. This paper proposes a disentanglement-and-calibration module (DAC) to address this issue. The disentanglement component separates the features into domain-shared and domain-specific features, while the calibration component corrects the domain-specific features. We demonstrate that the DAC module can significantly enhance the generalization capability of several baseline methods. Furthermore, we show that MatchingNet with the DAC module outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 10%-11% when trained on mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, Cars196, Places365 and tested on Plantae dataset.","tags":null,"title":"DAC: Disentanglement-and-Calibration Module for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Runqi WANG","Hao ZHENG","Xiaoyue Duan","Jianzhuang LIU","Yuning LU","Tian WANG","Songcen XU","Baochang ZHANG"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687046400,"objectID":"97ab16d4017250aaf6e2e790ad2dddc0","permalink":"https://jarucezh.github.io/publication/cvpr/","publishdate":"2023-06-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cvpr/","section":"publication","summary":"Pre-trained vision-language models have inspired much research on few-shot learning. However, with only a few training images, there exist two crucial problems:(1) the visual feature distributions are easily distracted by class-irrelevant information in images, and (2) the alignment between the visual and language feature distributions is difficult. To deal with the distraction problem, we propose a Selective Attack module, which consists of trainable adapters that generate spatial attention maps of images to guide the attacks on class-irrelevant image areas. By messing up these areas, the critical features are captured and the visual distributions of image features are calibrated. To better align the visual and language feature distributions that describe the same object class, we propose a cross-modal distribution alignment module, in which we introduce a vision-language prototype for each class to align the distributions, and adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to optimize the prototypes. For efficient computation, the upper bound of EMD is derived. In addition, we propose an augmentation strategy to increase the diversity of the images and the text prompts, which can reduce overfitting to the few-shot training images. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior arts in few-shot learning.","tags":null,"title":"Few-Shot Learning with Visual Distribution Calibration and Cross-Modal Distribution Alignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao ZHENG","Runqi WANG","Jianzhuang LIU","Asako KANEZAKI"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682985600,"objectID":"09121922edb964d745d2f735b044079d","permalink":"https://jarucezh.github.io/publication/cld/","publishdate":"2023-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cld/","section":"publication","summary":"The conventional few-shot classification aims at learning a model on a large labeled base dataset and rapidly adapting to a target dataset that is from the same distribution as the base dataset. However, in practice, the base and the target datasets of few-shot classification are usually from different domains, which is the problem of cross-domain few-shot classification. We tackle this problem by making a small proportion of unlabeled images in the target domain accessible in the training stage. In this setup, even though the base data are sufficient and labeled, the large domain shift still makes transferring the knowledge from the base dataset difficult. We meticulously design a cross-level knowledge distillation method, which can strengthen the ability of the model to extract more discriminative features in the target dataset by guiding the network's shallow layers to learn higher-level information. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the overfitting in the evaluation stage, we propose a feature denoising operation which can reduce the feature redundancy and mitigate overfitting. Our approach can surpass the previous state-of-the-art method, Dynamic-Distillation, by 5.44% on 1-shot and 1.37% on 5-shot classification tasks on average in the BSCD-FSL benchmark.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-Level Distillation and Feature Denoising for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao ZHENG","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
